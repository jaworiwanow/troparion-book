## TRanscribing Orthodox Psalmody And Rendering it ONline 

This Jupyter Book is an artefact documenting the requirements for a software solution aimed to help musicologists transcribe Orthodox Psalmody form Byzantine musical notation into modern Western Notation.  

The project itself can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/jaworiwanow/troparion) and there is also a [wiki](https://github.com/jaworiwanow/troparion/wiki) available.
