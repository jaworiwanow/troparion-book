# Challenges and Lessons learned

## Challenges
A large portion of the challenges were finding technical solutions. 

While, for example, there are unicode sets for Byzantine musical notation symbols, I was unable to get them to be displayed and of the theoretically available fonts most were discontinued and only accessible through archived webpages. 

Getting certain types of output within or outside of docker also proved a significant challenge and one only partially solved. 

"Dirty" workarounds through graphics and unicode symbols also had to be used in the practical implementation's current version, as it was impossible to get functioning buttons with different fonts in streamlit. 


## Lessons Learned
In working on this project I learned plenty about software design and architecture, and were I to begin anew, I would change significant aspects of the practical implementation and spend much more time in research before writing the first bit of code.

The most important lesson I've learned is that one should never assume requirements to be met or technical solutions to be available just because it seems probable and would make sense.,

And while I have always been of the opinion that precision is of utmost importance in definitions and formulations, thinking through different versions the requirements requierments and how another person might perceive and interpret served as excellent proof of that belief.
