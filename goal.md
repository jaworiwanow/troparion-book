# Goal
The goal is to create a lightweight app with cross-platform availability that allows for the transcription of Byzantine musical notation in order of facilitating musicological analysis.

It should allow for text output for the liturgically relevant languages (thus having the eventual support for Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew and Latin scripts) and initially focus on the three largest ones (Cyrillic, Greek and Latin).

The main target demographic are musicologists as well as musicians and composers interested in the Byzantine musical traditions outside of liturgical performance.
